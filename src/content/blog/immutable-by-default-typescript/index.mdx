I didn't "_go functional_." I just got tired of spooky side-effects and fragile refactors. Immutability wasn't a Big Rewrite - more like **small defaults** that kept paying off. This post is how I use it day-to-day: why it helps, how I think about it, and the exact patterns I paste into real code.

## Why immutability?

Most of our bugs aren't clever; they're incidental. You pass an array into a helper and it quietly `push`es. A config object gets tweaked in place during a refactor. A function signature says `User[]`, but the function mutates the input, so your caller's state changes from the other side of the app.

TypeScript can't prevent every runtime footgun, but it can make a whole class of them impossible to write. In TS, immutability is a **type-level promise**: no runtime cost.

- `const` prevents rebinding.
- `readonly` prevents writes.
- `as const` turns literals into _precise_ types.

There's a nice side-effect: once your values are precise, you can do better type narrowing and you can _derive_ unions from data. That makes APIs self-documenting and refactors safer.

For example:

```ts
const createBlogUrl = (slug: string) => `/blog/${slug}` as const
// Return type is `/blog/${string}`, not just `string`.
```

That tiny `as const` tells the compiler: "this always starts with `/blog/`." Downstream code can use that to narrow or validate.

So what does this look like in practice?

## How I approach it

My rule of thumb is: **immutable at the edges** and relax only where it buys me something.

- **Public APIs** accept `readonly` inputs and return new values. Internals can still mutate local variables if that's simpler, but the surface area is safe by default.
- **Values first, types from values.** I define literal tables with `as const`, then derive unions from them. There's a single source of truth.
- **Use `satisfies` to validate** that a value covers a type - without losing the literal precision I get from `as const`.
- **Don't be dogmatic.** If a local mutation is clearer and doesn't leak, I'll do it - then return a new value.

Let's walk through the patterns that make this work.

### Value tables â†’ unions you can trust

Instead of scattering string literals across your code, freeze them in one place and let TypeScript do the heavy lifting.

```ts
const FEATURES = ['posts', 'comments', 'users', 'groups'] as const
const OPERATIONS = ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'] as const

type Feature = (typeof FEATURES)[number]
type Operation = (typeof OPERATIONS)[number]
type Permission = `${Feature}:${Operation}`

const buildPermissions = (
  features: readonly Feature[],
  operations: readonly Operation[],
): readonly Permission[] =>
  features.flatMap((f) => operations.map((o) => `${f}:${o}` as const))

const PERMISSIONS = buildPermissions(FEATURES, OPERATIONS) satisfies readonly Permission[]
```

Whenever you add a new feature or operation, the compiler updates the entire permission set. No typos, no missed strings. Just one definition, everywhere consistent.

This pattern scales beyond static permissions.
Hereâ€™s a real-world example from a Todo app: the **filter state** that powers both our business logic and the UI tabs.

```ts
export const FILTER_STATE = {
  all: 'all',
  done: 'done',
  notDone: 'not-done',
} as const

export type TodoFilter = (typeof FILTER_STATE)[keyof typeof FILTER_STATE]

const filterFunctions = {
  [FILTER_STATE.all]: (todos: Todo[]) => todos,
  [FILTER_STATE.done]: (todos: Todo[]) => todos.filter((t) => t.isDone),
  [FILTER_STATE.notDone]: (todos: Todo[]) => todos.filter((t) => !t.isDone),
} as const satisfies Record<TodoFilter, (todos: Todo[]) => Todo[]>
```

And then in the UI:

```tsx
<Tabs.Root value={filter} onValueChange={(d) => onFilterChange(d.value as TodoFilter)}>
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Trigger value={FILTER_STATE.all}>All</Tabs.Trigger>
    <Tabs.Trigger value={FILTER_STATE.notDone}>Not Done</Tabs.Trigger>
    <Tabs.Trigger value={FILTER_STATE.done}>Done</Tabs.Trigger>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Content value={filter}>{children}</Tabs.Content>
</Tabs.Root>
```

ðŸ‘‰ Why this works so well:

- **Single source of truth.** The filter values (`'all' | 'done' | 'not-done'`) live in one place. Add a new filter and the compiler forces you to update the functions and tabs.
- **Types from values.** `TodoFilter` is derived from `FILTER_STATE`. You canâ€™t pass an invalid string anywhereâ€”TypeScript will catch it.
- **Immutable guarantees.** Because the table is `as const`, the keys and values are frozen. No widening to plain `string`, no typos slipping through.
- **End-to-end consistency.** The same literal drives your state, your filter functions, and your UI. Thereâ€™s zero chance of your logic and UI drifting apart.

Itâ€™s not just about immutabilityâ€”itâ€™s about **locking values, types, and logic together**. Thatâ€™s what makes this pattern so powerful.

### Template literal types that carry intent

Once you start [treating strings as _types_](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html), you can encode intent directly in them.

```ts
const isBlogUrl = (url: string): url is `/blog/${string}` => url.startsWith('/blog/')
```

Functions that expect a blog URL can now _say so_ in the signature. That tiny guard helps future maintainers - or future you.

### `as const`, explicit types, and `satisfies` without the traps

Here's the trick: let `as const` infer, and use `satisfies` to validate. That way you get the best of both worlds: precise types and compile-time checks.

```ts
type Hex = '#ff0000' | '#00ff00' | '#0000ff'

const COLORS = ['#ff0000', '#00ff00', '#0000ff']
  as const satisfies readonly Hex[]

const COLOR_MAP = {
  red: '#ff0000',
  green: '#00ff00',
  blue: '#0000ff',
} as const satisfies Record<string, Hex>
```

This avoids accidental widening and keeps both values and types locked in sync.

<Alert title="Gotcha" intent="warning">
  Be cautious when using the `satisfies` operator with **arrays**.  
  The [TypeScript
  documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-9.html#the-satisfies-operator)
  says:

&ldquo;_The new `satisfies` operator lets us validate that the type of an expression matches some type, **without changing the resulting type of that expression**._&rdquo;

However, this isnâ€™t entirely true. Letâ€™s look at three simple examples:

```ts
const COLORS = ['#ff0000', '#00ff00', '#0000ff'] as const
// 1) ?^ const COLORS: readonly ["#ff0000", "#00ff00", "#0000ff"]

const COLORS = ['#ff0000', '#00ff00', '#0000ff'] as const satisfies Hex[]
// 2) ?^ const COLORS: ["#ff0000", "#00ff00", "#0000ff"]

const COLORS = ['#ff0000', '#00ff00', '#0000ff'] as const satisfies readonly Hex[]
// 3) ?^ const COLORS: readonly ["#ff0000", "#00ff00", "#0000ff"]
```

Notice the difference?

As soon as we add `satisfies` after `as const` **without** `readonly` (example 2), the `readonly` qualifier is dropped from the type.

ðŸ’¡ So whenever you use `as const satisfies` with an array, remember to explicitly add `readonly` if you donâ€™t want to lose it in the type signature.

</Alert>

### Function signatures that say "I won't mutate your stuff"

Marking inputs `readonly` is a type-level promise: _"This function won't mess with your data."_

```ts
const sum = (values: readonly number[]): number =>
  values.reduce((total, v) => total + v, 0)
```

Same implementation as a mutable version, but infinitely clearer at the call site.

Whatâ€™s more, `readonly` **removes mutating methods** from the type. You wonâ€™t even see `push`, `sort`, or `splice` in autocomplete, because those would break the promise. This forces you to:

- **Copy first** if you really need to mutate (`const copy = [...values]`).
- Or better: reach for the **immutable ES2023 array methods** like `toSorted`, `toSpliced`, or `toReversed`.

```ts
const sorted = values.toSorted() // immutable alternative to sort()
const withoutFirst = values.toSpliced(0, 1) // immutable splice
const reversed = values.toReversed() // immutable reverse
```

Thatâ€™s the real win: the type system nudges you into writing pure functions and makes mutation an explicit choice, not an accident.

And when you expose collections, return immutable views:

```ts
const internalCache = new Map<string, number>()

export function getCache(): ReadonlyMap<string, number> {
  return internalCache
}
```

Internally flexible, externally safe.

### Updating state without mutation

The real test of immutability is when you need to _change_ something. The answer isn't "never change" - it's "return a new value instead of mutating the old one."

```ts
type Todo = { id: string; title: string; isDone: boolean }

const toggleTodo = (todos: readonly Todo[], id: Todo['id']): readonly Todo[] =>
  todos.map((t) => (t.id === id ? { ...t, isDone: !t.isDone } : t))

const upsertById = <T extends { id: string | number }>(
  items: readonly T[],
  item: T,
): readonly T[] => {
  const index = items.findIndex((i) => i.id === item.id)
  return index === -1 ? items.concat(item) : items.with(index, item)
}
```

Pure functions. Clean diffs. No spooky side effects.

### Deep immutability (only when you really need it)

When you use `as const`, the entire value becomes deeply immutableâ€”no matter how many levels of nesting there are.

In contrast, `Readonly<T>` only makes the **top-level properties** immutable. Nested objects remain mutable unless you explicitly wrap them in `Readonly<...>` as well.

```ts
// `Readonly<T>` is shallow: only top-level properties are readonly.
const user: Readonly<{
  name: string
  profile: { greeting: string } // <- nested object is NOT readonly
}> = {
  name: 'Alice',
  profile: { greeting: 'Hello' },
}

user.name = 'Bob'
// ^ Error: `user.name` is readonly (top-level)

user.profile = { greeting: 'Hi' }
// ^ Error: `user.profile` is readonly as a top-level property (canâ€™t reassign the object)

user.profile.greeting = 'Hola'
// ^ OK: `profile` itself is readonly, but its inner fields are still mutable
```

In practice, shallow immutability is usually enough.
But if you need **deep immutability**, you can define a utility type instead of wrapping each level in `Readonly<T>` manually:

```ts
type DeepReadonly<T> = T extends (...args: unknown[]) => unknown
  ? T
  : T extends object
    ? { readonly [K in keyof T]: DeepReadonly<T[K]> }
    : T
```

### Exhaustive unions that fail loudly

When you pair immutability with discriminated unions, the compiler won't let you forget a case.

```ts
type Msg =
  | { kind: 'info'; text: string }
  | { kind: 'success'; text: string }
  | { kind: 'warning'; text: string; code: number }
  | { kind: 'error'; text: string; stack?: string }

const renderMessage = (m: Readonly<Msg>) => {
  switch (m.kind) {
    case 'info':
    case 'success':
      return m.text
    case 'warning':
      return `${m.code}: ${m.text}`
    case 'error':
      return m.stack ?? m.text
    default: {
      const _exhaustive: never = m
      return _exhaustive
    }
  }
}
```

Compile-time guarantees, runtime peace of mind.

### Interop with Validators

Immutable tuples don't just help TypeScript; they also make runtime validation a breeze.

```ts
import { z } from 'zod'

const STATUSES = ['draft', 'published', 'archived'] as const

export type Status = (typeof STATUSES)[number]
export const StatusSchema = z.enum(STATUSES)
```

One definition, two worlds covered: compile-time types and runtime checks. No drifting copies, no sync issues.

## Wrapping up

Immutability in TypeScript isn't dogma. It's just a set of defaults that turn _"hope this doesn't mutate"_ into _"can't mutate even if I try."_

Start with small steps:

- Define literals with `as const`.
- Accept `readonly` inputs.
- Derive unions from values.

From there, you'll notice cleaner diffs, safer refactors, and APIs that explain themselves.

And when a local mutation is the clearest option? Do it - but keep the boundary immutable. That's the whole game: predictable code people enjoy maintaining.
