## Preact Counter Component

<div>
  <Counter client:load />
</div>

Let's see how to implement the component above in **Preact**.

I love `preact`. Let's have a look below. It's just React

```tsx
import { useState } from 'preact/hooks'

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    setCount((prev) => ++prev)
  }

  return (
    <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={handleIncrement}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Invariant

See how to use `tiny-invariant`

```ts
import invariant from 'tiny-invariant'

const truthyValue = 'Hello World!'
const falsyValue = null

invariant(truthyValue, 'This should not throw!')

invariant(falsyValue, 'This will throw!')
```
