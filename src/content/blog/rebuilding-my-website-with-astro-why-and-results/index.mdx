## Introduction

This is a personal case study of how I rebuilt my own website - what I kept, what I threw
away, and why the new version feels so much better.

[The old site](https://old.marek.work) was built with Next.js, Sanity CMS, and the full
[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org) playbook. It looked solid on paper, but over time I
realized it didn't actually work for me. Short of three years later, I decided to start
fresh. This time the focus was on **simplicity, performance, and content**. The result is
a lean Astro-based site that does less but works better.

This isn't a migration - I ditched the old project entirely and built something new. Even
the content is different. For technical implementation details, see
[Part 2: Technical Case Study](/blog/building-my-astro-blog-technical-case-study).

## The Next.js Era

When I built the first version of my website, Next.js 13 had just launched. React Server
Components were the new hot thing, and I wanted to try them out on a real project. Using a
headless CMS felt like the natural complement: it was decoupled, flexible, and made the
site feel professional. So I paired Next.js with Sanity CMS, added a webhook for on-demand
revalidation, and deployed to Vercel. Classic Jamstack.

[Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation-with-revalidatetag)
worked flawlessly. Sanity gave me a polished interface for managing content. For a while,
I was happy.

But cracks started to show. The project was born at a time when Next.js was evolving
rapidly, and upgrades were painful. Defaults around caching flipped back and forth, and
every major release felt like relearning the framework. Meanwhile, Sanity - while
technically solid - added friction. Editing content through a CMS UI just didn't motivate
me to write. I'm a developer; I prefer treating content as source code. I realized that
despite building all the infrastructure, I never wrote a single blog post.

Performance also took a hit. I couldn't resist adding a Three.js model of a mechanical
keyboard to the homepage ? because why not show off my keyboard obsession? It looked cool
but tanked Core Web Vitals. And even with canonical tags in place, SEO was disappointing:
Google often indexed my Vercel preview URLs instead of the live site. Whether it was
domain authority, performance issues, or just Google's black box, the end result was that
my content barely surfaced in search.

## The Turning Point

After a couple of years, I looked at my site and asked: _what is this actually doing for
me?_ The answer was clear: not much. The CMS didn't encourage me to write. The site was
bloated with features I didn't use. And the complexity of keeping up with Next.js updates
drained motivation rather than sparked it.

When I finally decided to rewrite, I had two guiding principles:

- focus on the content
- keep everything as simple as possible

Astro was the obvious choice.

## The Astro Era

Astro approaches websites differently. It's static-first and ships zero JavaScript by
default, which means you start from a position of performance. When you need
interactivity, you add it explicitly through
[islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/). Content lives in Markdown or
MDX, typed and validated through Astro's content collections. The build output is static
HTML, perfect for CDN caching.

Here's how the two versions of my site compare at a glance:

| Category               | Old Website           | New Website                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Framework**          | Next.js               | Astro                        |
| **Hosting**            | Vercel                | Cloudflare Workers           |
| **Styling**            | Tailwind CSS          | Tailwind CSS                 |
| **UI Kit**             | Custom components     | DaisyUI                      |
| **Content**            | Sanity CMS            | MDX & Content Collections    |
| **Rendering strategy** | ISR with revalidation | Pure Static Generation       |
| **Interactivity**      | React                 | Preact through Astro islands |

Astro fit perfectly. It let me drop the CMS and just write MDX in my editor. It gave me
static HTML by default, with Preact islands where I needed a bit of client-side behavior.
And it shipped with thoughtful defaults: a sitemap, RSS feed, syntax highlighting with
Shiki, image optimization - all without extra setup. Deployment on Cloudflare Workers was
trivial.

## What Changed

The rebuild was surprisingly surgical. This is a completely new site, not a migration - I
started fresh with different content and structure. What made it feel surgical was how
much I could keep: TypeScript and Tailwind stayed, which meant I didn't need to relearn
syntax or rebuild my design system.

Everything else changed. The framework switch from Next.js to Astro meant dropping React
Server Components and ISR complexity. Moving from Sanity CMS to MDX meant content now
lives in my codebase, version-controlled and editable in my editor. The hosting shift from
Vercel to Cloudflare Workers was straightforward since Astro's static output works
anywhere. And I replaced custom components with DaisyUI to move faster.

Most importantly, I ditched that performance-killing Three.js keyboard model. The result?
A sub-300 kB homepage with perfect Lighthouse scores and proper Google indexing. But more
than the metrics, the real win is that I finally feel motivated to write. Writing MDX
files feels natural, like writing code - which is exactly what I wanted.

## The Results

As of writing, the site isn't live yet. Once published, I'll add concrete metrics here:
Lighthouse scores, bundle size comparisons, Core Web Vitals before/after, and actual SEO
performance data.

## Conclusion

I hope this insight gave you at least a bit of valuable information I learnt while
experimenting with Astro. I must say I really enjoy working with it and it's now my
default choice for any static (or mostly static) site.

Astro isn't the right tool for every project-I wouldn't use it for a highly interactive
dashboard, for example. But for content-heavy, static-first websites, it's an absolute
joy. And if I were starting a new project today that combined a marketing site with an
internal app, I'd seriously consider a hybrid approach: Astro for the landing pages, a
React SPA for the app, and a shared component library in a monorepo.

The best part is that I finally feel motivated to publish. Writing MDX files feels like
working with source code - I get syntax highlighting, version control, and the same editor
I use for everything else. No CMS UI to context-switch into, no webhook delays, no
wondering if my changes saved. It removes friction in a way that Sanity never did, despite
being technically excellent. And at the end of the day, that's the whole point - removing
the barriers between having an idea and publishing it.
