## The Project

I wanted to learn more about connecting Next.js apps to databases, so I built upon Theo's
excellent [tRPC tutorial](https://youtu.be/PKy2lYEnhgs). The result was "Cutest PokÃ©mon" -
a simple voting app where users choose between two randomly selected PokÃ©mon. While
heavily based on the tutorial, I made some modifications to make it my own learning
experience.

## What I Actually Built

### Core Functionality

The app randomly selects two PokÃ©mon from the Pokedex and lets users vote on which is
cuter. Votes are stored in a simple database schema:

```prisma
// schema.prisma
model Vote {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  votedFor       Pokemon @relation(name: "votesFor", fields: [votedForId], references: [id])
  votedForId     Int
  votedAgainst   Pokemon @relation(name: "votesAgainst", fields: [votedAgainstId], references: [id])
  votedAgainstId Int
}
```

<Image
  src={voteImg}
  alt="Voting page screenshot"
  widths={[360, 480, 720, 768, 960, 1024, 1280]}
  sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 768px"
  priority
  class="not-prose rounded-md"
/>

### Random Selection Logic

Basic random number generation with duplicate prevention:

```typescript
export const getOptionsForVote = () => {
  const firstId = getRandomPokemon()
  const secondId = getRandomPokemon(firstId)
  return [first, second]
}

export const getRandomPokemon: (notThisOne?: number) => number = (notThisOne) => {
  const pokedexNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * MAX_POKEDEX_ID) + 1

  if (pokedexNumber !== notThisOne) return pokedexNumber
  return getRandomPokemon(notThisOne)
}
```

### tRPC API

Two simple endpoints - one to get a PokÃ©mon pair, another to record votes:

```typescript
export const appRouter = trpc
  .router()
  .query('get-pokemon-pair', {
    async resolve() {
      const [first, second] = getOptionsForVote()
      const bothPokemon = await prisma.pokemon.findMany({
        where: { id: { in: [first, second] } },
      })
      return { firstPokemon: bothPokemon[0], secondPokemon: bothPokemon[1] }
    },
  })
  .mutation('cast-vote', {
    input: z.object({
      votedFor: z.number(),
      votedAgainst: z.number(),
    }),
    async resolve({ input }) {
      return await prisma.vote.create({
        data: {
          votedAgainstId: input.votedAgainst,
          votedForId: input.votedFor,
        },
      })
    },
  })
```

## What I Did Differently from the Tutorial

1. **Styled Components**: Used CSS-in-JS for styling (the tutorial used Tailwind)
2. **Project Structure**: Organized code into features rather than by file type

## Key Learning Outcomes

### Prisma Basics

- Setting up database schemas and relationships
- Basic CRUD operations with the Prisma client
- Database migrations and seeding

### tRPC Fundamentals

- Creating type-safe API endpoints
- Connecting frontend and backend with shared types
- Basic query and mutation patterns

### Next.js Features

- API routes for backend functionality
- Static generation for the results page
- Basic routing between pages

  sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 768px"
  class="not-prose rounded-md"
/>

## The Reality Check

This was very much a beginner project. The code is straightforward, the features are
basic, and there's nothing particularly innovative here. But it served its purpose:

- **Hands-on experience** with modern tools I'd only read about
- **Understanding the flow** from database to frontend
- **Building confidence** in working with full-stack TypeScript
- **Learning through modification** rather than just copying

## What I'd Do Differently Now

Looking back, Iâ€™d change quite a few things:

- I donâ€™t use **CSS-in-JS** anymore - I donâ€™t think itâ€™s the right approach, but thatâ€™s a
  topic for another article
- Extract more **logic into custom hooks** instead of keeping it inside components
- Use a proper **feature-sliced project structure**
- Avoid the old pattern of naming everything `index.ts` inside nested folders (I cringe
  looking back ðŸ˜…)
- Split components more thoughtfully
- Use **constants instead of magic numbers/strings**
- Dependencies are outdated - upgrading would cause too many breaking changes, so not
  worth it here

On a practical note, I recently had to switch the database provider to **Turso** to keep
the app running on a free tier. It was initially on **PlanetScale**, but they killed their
free tier a while back, so I resurrected this project with Turso just to make it usable
again.

## Conclusion

"Cutest PokÃ©mon" is exactly what it sounds like - a learning project that helped me
understand the basics of modern full-stack development. Itâ€™s not impressive code, but it
represents an important step in my journey. Sometimes the best way to learn is to build
something simple, make it work, and then understand why it works.

The project taught me that tools like Prisma and tRPC make full-stack development much
more approachable than I initially thought, even if the end result is just a basic voting
app.
