I wanted to learn more about **connecting Next.js app to a database**. So I created a very similar app that Theo shows in his [tutorial](https://youtu.be/PKy2lYEnhgs). I used styled-components instead of TailwindCSS and did some things differently to not just blindly follow a tutorial video.

I learned how to use **SSG** for the results page, **tRPC**, and interact with a database through **Prisma** ORM.
