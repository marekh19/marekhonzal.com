        I believe the web should be not only <strong class="font-bold">usable</strong>,
        but <strong class="font-bold">maintainable</strong> - for the teams who build it.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        That’s why I focus on <strong class="font-bold"
          >frontend architecture, state management</strong
        >, and <strong class="font-bold">developer experience</strong> - the parts of engineering
        that help codebases grow without growing painful.
      </TextBlock>

      <TextBlock>
        I didn’t start my career in tech - I spent <strong class="font-bold"
          >7 years in sales and marketing</strong
        >
        before taking a hard turn into software development. That pivot led me through an intensive
        bootcamp and into building everything from <strong>greenfield MVPs</strong> to <strong
          class="font-bold">design systems</strong
        > and <strong class="font-bold">internal platforms</strong> used by global teams.
      </TextBlock>

      <TextBlock>
        Today, I work as a <strong class="font-bold">Senior Frontend Developer</strong> at
        <Link href="https://applifting.io" hasIcon={false}>Applifting</Link>, based in
        Prague, Czechia, where I balance hands-on engineering with supporting the
        leadership of our <strong class="font-bold">20+ person frontend team</strong> - mentoring
        developers and shaping our tooling and practices.
      </TextBlock>

      <TextBlock>
        I created this site to <strong class="font-bold">share what I’ve learned</strong> -
        and what I’m still learning - about building better frontends, growing as a developer,
        and tinkering on side projects that challenge how we think about code.
