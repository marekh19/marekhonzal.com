I believe the web should be not only **usable**, but **maintainable** - for the teams who
build it.

That’s why I focus on **frontend architecture, state management**, and **developer
experience** - the parts of engineering that help codebases grow without growing painful.

I didn’t start my career in tech - I spent **7 years in sales and marketing** before
taking a hard turn into software development. That pivot led me through an intensive
bootcamp and into building everything from **greenfield MVPs** to **design systems** and
**internal platforms** used by global teams.

Today, I work as a **Senior Frontend Developer** at
{<Link href="https://applifting.io/" hasIcon={false}> Applifting</Link>}, based in Prague,
Czechia, where I balance hands-on engineering with supporting the leadership of our **20+
person frontend team** - mentoring developers and shaping our tooling and practices.

I created this site to **share what I’ve learned** - and what I’m still learning - about
building better frontends, growing as a developer, and tinkering on side projects that
challenge how we think about code.
