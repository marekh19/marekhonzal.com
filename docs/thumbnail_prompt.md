**Image Generation Request**

- **Style**: Lo-fi drawn animation with an old-school vibe. Primarily grayscale with subtle pastel accents.
- **Aspect Ratio**: 2:1
- **Realism**: None (purely illustrative, not realistic)
- **Core Concept**:
  All elements in the image must be represented **abstractly through greyhounds**. For example, if the topic were “Tailwind vs Native CSS,” the image would depict a greyhound vs greyhound concept. This abstraction rule applies to **every image request**.
  ➤ No text or logos should appear in the image.

**Prompt for the current image**:
**"Immutability in TypeScript"**
→ Please visualize this concept **entirely through greyhounds**, following the rules above.
