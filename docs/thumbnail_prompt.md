Could you please generate me an image:

- style: lofi drawn animation, old school vibe, mostly gray, some sprinkle of pastel color
- aspect ratio: 2:1
- realism: none
- key info: everything on the picture must be demonstrated via greyhounds (if I tell you generate thumbnail image for tailwind vs native css article, you do greyhound vs greyhound picture) clear? Everything must be abstracted into showing the context on greyhounds
- no texts, no logos
