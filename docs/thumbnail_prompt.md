Lo-fi old-school hand-drawn animation style, primarily grayscale with very subtle pastel accents. Aspect ratio exactly 1200×630 pixels (1.9:1). Everything in the scene must be represented only through greyhounds, no humans, text, code, or literal objects. Place the main action inside a safe central area, leaving a 10% border on all sides free of important content, while background and decoration extend fully to the edges with no visible frame or border. Scene concept: “Immutability in TypeScript” — visualize greyhounds demonstrating immutability, such as passing along an object that stays unchanged, or one trying to alter something but it remains frozen and unaffected.
